Kinly Inc. is ringing in the new year with a host of new challenges and opportunities! Starting off January with a blast is the Synapse: Life Science competition hosted by Innovation Factory in Hamilton, ON. The competition is run alongside some well-known players in the Hamilton health game, such as McMaster University, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton Health Sciences, as well as [many more](http://www.synapselifescience.com/sponsors).

The Kinly team will be participating in the competition alongside Sarrah Lal, a current MBA student at McMaster University with experience in corporate consultation and market intelligence. We look forward to working with Sarrah, and repeating our competition success at Innovation Factory!
